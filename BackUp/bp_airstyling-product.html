      to hold a hairstyle in place.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Hairstyling products have had a significant impact on the creation of
        various hairstyles and trends throughout history. For the ancient
        Egyptians, physical appearance was very important to the embalming
        process. Hair was often styled to maintain the individuality of the
        deceased. A fatty substance, now known as hair gel, was used to style
        hair and keep it in place. The 1980s punk movement popularized using
        hair gel to sculpt spiky hairstyles, such as mohawks. The ancient
        Gauls had invented a waxy soap-like substance, similar to hair wax, as a
        hair styling agent. Many years later, the same soap-like substance was
        used as a cleaning agent. In 1948, Chase Products became the first
        company to package hair spray. Hair spray became very popular in the
        1950s due to its ability to keep hair in place and prevent hair from
        falling out of a styled look.

    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>
      Hair gel is a hairstyle product that is used to stiffen hair into a
      particular hairstyle. The end result is similar to, but stronger than,
      those of hair spray. Hair gel is most commonly used in the hairstyling
      of men, but it is not gender specific. Hair gel can come in tubes, pots,
      small bags, or even in a spray form.
    </p>

    <h3>Hair wax</h3>
    <img src="/ZoltansBlog/images/HairWax.jpg" alt="hair wax open">
    <p>
      Hair wax is a thick hair styling product containing wax, which helps
      hold hair in place. Unlike some products such as hair gel which leave
      the hair hard in texture, hair wax leaves the hair pliable. Many
      manufacturers are now releasing different versions of hair wax, such as
      pomade, putty, glue, glypto, whip, and styling paste.
    </p>

    <h3>Hair mousse</h3>
    <img src="/ZoltansBlog/images/HairMousse.jpg" alt="white hair mousse on
        hand">
    <p>Hair mousse is a product added to hair for extra volume and shine. It is
      most commonly produced as a cream, but can also be found as a spray.
      Hair mousse adds volume without causing clumps or buildup. It is a
      lighter alternative to hair gel. Mousse is generally applied to the
      roots of damp hair before blow drying or styling. Mousse may also be
      used to add definition to curls, or to add texture to hair for a beach
      blown effect.</p>

    <h3>Pomade</h3>
    <img src="/ZoltansBlog/images/HairPomade.jpg" alt="A small pot of hair
        pomade">
    <p>
      Pomade is an oil based or water based product designed for slick and
      tight hairstyles. Unlike hair spray and hair gel, pomade does not dry
      and often takes several washes to remove. Grease-cutting shampoos and
      deep-cleansing conditioners can be used to quicken the removal process.
      Other methods of removal include the use of olive oil, dish washing
      liquid, and lemon juice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most oil based pomades contain petroleum jelly (and in fact, petroleum
      jelly can be used alone as a pomade) and mineral oil, and many also
      contain some sort of wax. They may also contain perfume and coloring
      agents. A plethora of pomades are still in production today and vary in
      factors such as weight, shine, and scent. The stiffest will have a
      higher proportion of beeswax while the lightest may have a higher
      proportion of oils.
    </p>

    <h3>Hair spray</h3>
    <img src="/ZoltansBlog/images/Hairspray.jpg" alt="Cans of hairspray">
    <p>
      Hair spray is a common household aqueous solution which is used to
      stiffen hair into a certain style. It was first developed and
      manufactured in 1948 by Chase Products, based in Broadview, Illinois.
      Weaker than hair gel or hair wax, it is sprayed directly onto the hair
      to hold styles for long periods of time. It sprays evenly over the hair
      using a pump or aerosol spray nozzle. The product may leave hair feeling
      'crunchy' unless brushed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The active ingredients in hair spray are called polymers, which keep the
      hair stiff and firm without snapping. Solvents, which make up most of
      the content of the hairspray, are responsible for carrying these
      polymers in a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally, the solvent found in hair spray was a chlorofluorocarbon
      (CFC). CFCs are nontoxic, nonflammable, and make almost ideal aerosol
      propellants. However, when research concluded that CFCs cause
      destruction of stratospheric ozone, they were replaced with other
      solvents, such as alcohols and hydrocarbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the polymers used in hair spray is polyvinylpyrrolidone, which is
      water-soluble. The non-water-soluble polymer polydimethylsiloxane is
      added to make the hold last a bit longer. Some less common polymers
      found in hair spray include copolymers with vinyl acetate and copolymers
      with maleic anhydride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hair sprays use natural polymers and solvents like vegetable gums
      dissolved in alcohol. One popular ingredient in natural hair sprays is
      gum arabic, which is made from the sap of various species of the acacia
      tree. Gum tragacanth is another herbal gum that is used to stiffen
      calico and crepe, as well as hair.
    </p>

    <h3>Hair volumizer</h3>
    <p>
      Hair volumizers are used to temporarily add volume, body and shine to
      thin or flat hair. Hair volumizers are used by both men and women. Men
      turn to hair volumizers to make their hair look more dense. Volumizers
      come in many forms such as shampoos, conditioners, sprays, pomades and
      lotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hair volumizers contain humectants, which work by attracting moisture
      from the surrounding areas to the hair strand, thereby swelling the hair
      and making it look thicker. Various polymers present in the volumizer
      coat the hair strand, making it look thicker and shiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shampoo and conditioner forms of the volumizers are used just like
      ordinary shampoo or conditioners. The spray and lotion form of
      volumizers are used on damp hair near the roots of the hair. In order to
      use a hair volumizer, the person using the product must flip their head
      downward and gradually blow dry the hair, with the air being blown along
      the shaft of the hair until the hair is dry. Drying the hair in this
      position will increase volume and achieve the desired effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the hairstyling products listed above are the most commonly used,
      there are other types of products as well. Serums, leave-in conditioner,
      clays, hair tonic, hair dry powder shampoo, and heat protection sprays
      are frequently used hairstyling products in salons and homes across the
      country.
    </p>

    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <p>
      When applied properly, most styling products will not damage the hair.
      However, there is always a risk of the hair drying out when using any
      type of styling product. Some styling products contain ingredients that
      can dissolve the hair's natural oils, or ingredients which can cause a
      build-up that results in so-called "dull hair". This build-up of harmful
      ingredients can cause problems such as dry hair, hair breakage, eczema,
      or the thinning of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using a hair dryer to dry and shape one's hair, the heat being
      applied can cause damage to the hair strands. This heat damage can
      be prevented by using some sort of heat protectant spray.
